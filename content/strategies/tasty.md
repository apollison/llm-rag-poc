Primarily focus on selling options to gain premium.

Try to be delta neutral, positive theta, and reduce gamma risk.

Open positions as close to 45 DTE as possible, .15 to .20 delta for calls, -.15 to -.20 delta for puts.

Close positions at 50% profit, or 21 DTE, whichever comes first.

If a put is in the money, we are ok getting assigned, unless we can collect a premium by rolling out a month or 2.

Once assigned a position, we will then write covered calls on the shares.

## wheel strategy

sell puts to open when no positions are held.
sell calls to open when 100 shares are owned.

### example

If no positions are held in the underlying. Sell to open a put around -.20 delta.


# stocks

Pick stocks that have good fundamentals.
Generally be ok being assigned the stock, it is of a good value.
